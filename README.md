# ⭐ Introduction from the Project:

Hello guys!

Welcome to the Corporate Bankruptcy Prediction Project!

In this Project, we will explore if we can make machine learning models can predict if a company goes bankrupt or not.

Many people could easily assume "Oh, this company got bankrupt simply becauase they lost money and went to debt". But this is always not true. In fact, there are many factors that combine to make a company go bankrupt. We will soon examine a data set that has 95 predictor variables that explain if a company goes bankrupt or not.

You may have heard some stories of companies going bankrupt. Some notable companies such as Blockbuster and Toys R US have gone bankrupt in 2010 and 2017 respectively.

### Blockbuster

There are a few main reasons Blockbuster went bankrupt, here are a few:

* Blockbuster walked away from a Netflix deal:

In this deal, Blockbuster would buy Netflix for 50 million dollars. "If the deal went through Netflix would have managed Blockbuster’s online business" (McKinnon).


* The inability to adapt quickly:

Blockbuster let people rent DVDs in their stores, but Netflix mailed DVDs in people's houses. As a fun fact, Netflix mailed DVDs in 1998 and stopped this service in 2023 (ABC7).

Mailing DVDs made it convient for people to watch movies in their homes without traveling to other stores.




* Heavy Debt Burden:

All of Blockbuster's problems eventually resulted in big debt.

"When Blockbuster filed for bankruptcy, it had 1 billion dollars in debt" (McKinnon).

### Toys R US

There are a few main reasons Toys R US went bankrupt, here are a few:

* Online Shopping:

CBS news states that "One possible culprit, the explosion in online shopping also wreaking havoc on other big-box stores, is certainly a factor. But the spread of Amazon and other ecommerce players into every corner of the economy is only part of the answer, and not the main cause of Toys "R" Us' decline" (CBS).

* Kids are shifting their enjoyment from toys to video games:

It appears that more kids are leaning towards video games for entertainment instead of toys. A example of this is Fornite. In a Fornite statistics article it states, "More than 60% of Fortnite players are between 18 and 24 years old. Although many younger users lie about their age to get access to Fortnite, the percentage is calculated according to the DOB entered while registering as a user" (Kumar).  

CBS News states that "The Lego company is witnessing first sales decline as of 2017, partly due to shift of children's interest from toys to video games" (CBS).


* Poor Marketing Strategy:

Again, CBS News says "One of Walmart's holiday strategies is to slash toy prices to lure consumers into its stores. One study found the retail giant discounted its popular toys by 54 percent on average compared with Amazon. In its bankruptcy filing, Toys R Us noted that Amazon is 'not concerned with making a profit at this juncture, rendering their pricing model impossible to compete with' " (CBS).

Apparently, Toys R Us did not low price cuts as Walmart during holiday seasons, and made buying toys in Toys R Us less attractive.

### Predicting Bankruptcy with data

While these two stories are insightful on how a company goes out of business, lets see if we can use data to detect if a company goes bankrupt.

For instance, it sounds reasonable that checking profit and sales numbers may indicate if a company would go bankrupt or not.

And it appears that bankruptcy happens due to many reasons instead of one sole reason. So what if we account for many reasons?


Can we classify if a Company will be bankrupt using machine learning models? Especially when we have over 90 variables?

Lets find out!
